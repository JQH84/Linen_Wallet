# Linen Mobile inc

## Overview and Origin

Linen app was founded by both Alex Bazhanau, Vitaly Bahachuk in 2018. As per [Crunchbase.com](https://www.crunchbase.com), the company was originally known as Blocboard which was an Ethereum based Dapp that didn't get much user base or adoption. The main goal of Blocboard was to be a P2P borrowing and lending app for cryptocurrency. However, Linen today is striving to be more than just a lending platform between peers and does offer DeFi yield products from within the non-custodial multi sig wallet powered by [Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/) which is an Ethereum Smart contract that requires a minimum number of people to approve any transactions on the blockchain.

According to [**Crunchbase.com**](https://www.crunchbase.com) , the company has had 5 funding rounds with only 1 round from polygon chain with an estimated worth of 1$M and several undisclosed amounts from other investors. Other sources including [**KingCrowd**](https://kingscrowd.com/linen-app-on-republic/) reported a funding round of 4.9$M from popular crowd funding site [**Republic.io**](https://Republic.io).

## Business Activities

Linen is aiming to empower the cryptocurrency user with a highly secure self custody wallet solution that is directly connected to the blockchain to take full advantage of decentralized finance and Web3.0 applications. A recent article published on [**Crypto scammers stole $500K from wallets using targeted Google Ads**](https://www.engadget.com/crypto-scammers-google-ads-phishing-campaign-100044007.html) shows an example of how unsafe seed phrases can be as they are a single point of failure. The main features of this wallet are:

- No Single Point Of Failure
- No Need to Write Down a Seed Phrase
- Powered by Gnosis safe smart contracts
- Easy recovery kit via Email , Phone and Cloud storage file

The main consumer base targeted by linen are those that are looking to make some interest on their idle crypto assets. The main advantage they offer as of today is simply the more robust security model for the wallet. The yield rates for lending the crypto assets are not very competitive as compared to some other providers. The room for growth however is massive with a reported market capitalization of around 137B$ as of Dec 16th 2021 for the Defi Space.

Linen has built a smartphone app that can be downloaded to access the wallet. as mentioned earlier they relay on the security technology provided by [**Gnosis**](https://gnosis-safe.io/) and this link showcases detailed description of their [**Security model**](https://linen.app/articles/crypto-assets-self-custody-linen-wallet-primer/). Other technologies the bushiness uses include :

1) CSS
2) Ethereum Smart-Contracts
2) React JS
3) [Wallet Connect](https://walletconnect.com/)

As this is in the early stages of development, not much info was found on the web regarding the exact technologies used for their product development.

## Landscape

Blockchain technology and in particular smart contract platforms like Ethereum have made many traditional financial products available to the masses through what is called Defi (Decentralized Finance). Products concerned with Defi have gained much attraction in 2018 and have been trending ever since then. Linen is mainly a crypto and blockchain domain centric company and is currently utilizing the Defi space applications as part of the offerings. They provide a gateway for their users to interact with Defi Solutions of lending/borrowing , trading on decentralized exchanges and access to cheaper layer-2 Ethereum protocols like Polygon.

Prior to DeFi making headlines back in 2018 , the main products offered by smart contract blockchains was DEX's ( Decentralized exchanges) that provided trading opportunities for users. Innovations within this space have not ended with Defi as many other application of this technology are gaining adoption like **NFT's** ([Non-Fungible Tokens](https://www.investopedia.com/non-fungible-tokens-nft-5115211)) and **DAO's** ([Decentralized Autonomous Organizations](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-dao/)

Some of linen competitor companies and or projects within this domain are listed below :

- [Argent Wallet](https://www.argent.xyz/) - Top competitor for what Linen is trying to establish
- DeFi Wallet by [Crypto.com](https://www.crypto.com)
- [Nexo](www.coinbase.com)

## Results

As linen is still in an early stage of development , they have no created a big impact on the industry. Their value proposition will be beneficial for consumers that are worried and do no want to fall victim to the scammers and bad actors in the crypto industry.

Some Basic Metrics to consider for any mobile app are user engagement and retention. unfortunately these Metrics and KPI's are not disclosed by Linen yet but a a quick look through Alexa Rank does show a growing interest in the website user and visit statistics as shown below

[![Alexa Rank](Linen_Wallet/alexa_rank.png)](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/linen.app)

however some other metrics like engagement and daily time on the sit do show  a slight decline. If we consider the same Alexa rank for a competitor like Argent which has a rank of 38,273 we can see that linen still has some room to capture those Argent users.

## Recommendations

Based on all the information gathered about Linen i would suggest the following points for this app:

- Focus on the Multi-Sig security offering and how important it can be to safeguard against scammers and hackers as compromised seed phrases are a very common issue these days.
- Highlight the fact that the Multi-sig wallet is available to all users and not limited by any specific amount as seen by their Argent competition.
- Offer better yields and more verity as currently they seem to be using only [Compound Finance/](https://compound.finance/) for the staking and savings.
- direct connection to traditional bank accounts using API's and services like Plaid that would allow easy access to funds for traditional spending.

Having multiple yield products will give consumers more options and thus encourage more users to utilize the service and having a direct API technologies to connect with traditional banks will allow most users to have an easier transition into the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.
